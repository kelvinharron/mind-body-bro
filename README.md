# Mind Body Bro

Goal builder app concept written for Android Marshmallow. Idea of creating goals for yourself and your friends, focusing on the small steps to achieving something like getting out of bed or out of the house which is something those with anxiety and depression can certainly struggle with.

Created at the MoHack 2016 Hackathon in Belfast. https://www.eventbrite.com/e/mohack-belfast-hackathon-for-movember-tickets-28239299505#

### Features

- Welcome screen prompting user for a goal.
- Ability to create a goal consisting of: 1) Goal name, 2) Goal Type, 3) Priority.
- View list of goal as android card objects implemented with a recycler view.
- View different types of goals in tab view as goal type.
